Phobos Mars Responsive Website Project
What does it do and what need does it fulfil?
This project uses skills learnt to build a mobile-first responsive Website for the new restaurant on Mars. It fulfils the need for the users to contact the restaurant, check the menu, book a table and also the user is able to have a good reading about the place. 

Functionality of project
The website is fully responsive, on desktop and larger screen sizes there is a small amount of additional content like the picture in "contact us". The navigation work as one single page having all the info linked to the nav bar on the top, where the user can select which page he wants to see. There’s also a form in the “book a table” section which is not going to send it to anyone. Also the social media links on the bottom it’s not linked to any social media page, it is linked to the home section. The menu in the other hand is a PDF file that it will open in a new window.

Deployment
Website was coded in the Cloud 9 IDE, a local GIT directory was used for version control and then uploaded to GITHUB using Ubuntu / Bash script. Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: https://vinicald.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/

Testing
The pages was tested using the locally GITHUB pages using Chrome Developer Tools, testing it’s functionality/look and feel. The website seems to work properly on all the devices below.
Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 6/7/8 also all the Plus variations, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and desktop.

Work based on other code
I have created most of the code, but I have looked for some ideas on the CV exercise / Whiskey Drop and also I have used the bootstrap guide.


What changed after user design experience (UDX) phase
I had planned first to create a website with different sections but after creating the UDX phase I notice that it will be better to have a single page with everything to be more modern and to make it simple for the users. I also decide to make the menu as PDF file in order to keep the user in the same page so he can check the menu and book a table at the same time.
